# The Alliance, The Gasworks

You may think this building is a stadium. It's actually my appartment complex as of 2019. It's also a reabilitated, London-made, Victorian-era Gasometer. What's that, you ask? Let's explore its history. 

### Dublin's gas history

<!--- Once upon a time there was... -->

In the 18th century, electricity wasn't a thing. Yet, Dublin still needed to keep its streets safely lit at night. 

<!--- Every day ... -->

Every day, dozens of workers refuelled the city lamps with whale oil or tallow. This was particularly costly to the city. 

Until one day, the concept of public gas was brought to Dublin from England. A few entrepreneurs spun up their own gas factories, storage facilities and distribution networks. 

The concept was simple - during the day, workers in the gasworks (gas factories) produced tons of gas by burning coal. They stored it in a large gas holder. 

When dawn came, 25 lamplighters hurried themselves through Dublin city to light up its 3750 gas lamps. Gas was distributed from the tanks to the lamps using networks of gas pipes. 

<!--- Because of that, we needed tanks ... -->

### Dublin's gas tanks

Gas usage boomed in Dublin. 

Street lighting made it safer to walk the streets. People lit up the inside of their homes with gas, too. The used it to cook, heat up water, read at night, etc. 

That's a lot of lamps, and a lot of gas. 

In 1866, the 5 private gas companies of the time merged into a monopoly, called the "*Alliance & Dublin Consumers' Gas Company*", or "the Dublin Gas Company". It was now in charge of all production, distribution, and - this is where gas tanks come in - ensuring gas storage capacity. 

Soon, gas-related structures peered through the South Lotts landscape: in 1871, the enterprise built the Clayton Gas holder. And in 1885, our dear *Alliance gas holder*. 

### The Alliance Gasometer

 The decorative wrought iron frame was made by the London firm of Samuel Cutler & Sons, and brought to Dublin by boat. When completed, the Gasholder was one of the largest *moving* metal structures in the world [1]

Why "moving", you may ask? The Alliance Gas Holder was actually a telescopic gas holder, floating on water. As the gasworks surrounding the tank produced gas, the gas was was pumped through the water into sections of the tank, and the gas holder *lifted itself*. 

The inner tank impressively rose up during the day and descended at night, using the beautiful Victorian iron frameworks around it as guides (check out [this video](https://youtu.be/QxCGta_rsUE?t=371) to see a similar gas holder in action).

Leaving engineering beauty aside, the industrial site was far from rosy in the South lotts back then. Some Dubliners recall:

> [The gasometers] floated on water, the pressure of the gas kept them up. So they had no bottom, and the gas used to seep into the water, and the smell sometimes got really bad, because there were leaks and the smell of gas was horrendous - Billy Ryan, 2004[0] 

> The worst thing about the gas company was the bad working
conditions. The workers should have been sent to the doctors, because
they suffered. It was very unhealthy, the fumes and all that. I think at
some stage they put up a warning that working here is a danger to
health. - Peter Montgomery, 2006 [0] 

### The downfall 

In the 20th century, two innovations called the downfall of the Gasworks: Electricity, and Natural Gas (a much cheaper way of extracting gas from deep underground rock formations, instead of extracing it from buring coal.)

Electricity became the norm for public and in-home lighting and killed demand. Natural gas became the cheaper replacement for everything else. 

The Gasworks stopped operating, and the Gasholder was abandonned.

### The revival 

Next, we'll cover how a real estate tycoon took over the structure, failed to sell units inside, tried and failed again to turn it into a hotel - all the way to becoming what it is today: a residential building inhabited by up to 80% Google employees.

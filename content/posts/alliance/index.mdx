This is my home, as of June 2020. It's also a reabilitated, London-made, Victorian-era Gasometer. 

### Dublin's gas History

In the 18th century, electricity wasn't a thing. Yet, Dublin still needed to keep its streets safely lit at night. 

Every day, dozens of workers refuelled the city lamps with whale oil or tallow. This was particularly costly to the city. 

Until one day, the concept of public gas was brought to Dublin from England. A few entrepreneurs spun up their own gas factories, storage facilities and distribution networks. 

The concept was simple - during the day, workers in the gasworks (gas factories) produced tons of gas by burning coal. They stored it in a large gas holder. 

When dawn came, 25 lamplighters hurried themselves through Dublin city to light up its 3750 gas lamps. Gas was distributed from the tanks to the lamps using networks of gas pipes. 

### Dublin's gas tanks

Gas usage boomed in Dublin. 

Street lighting made it safer to walk the streets. People lit up the inside of their homes with gas, too. The used it to cook, heat up water, read at night, etc. 

That's a lot of lamps, and a lot of gas. 

In 1866, the 5 private gas companies of the time merged into a monopoly, called the "*Alliance & Dublin Consumers' Gas Company*", or "the Dublin Gas Company". It was now in charge of all production, distribution, and - this is where gas tanks come in - ensuring gas storage capacity. 

Soon, gas-related structures peered through the South Lotts landscape: in 1871, the enterprise built the Clayton Gas holder. And in 1885, our dear *Alliance gas holder*. 

### The Alliance Gasometer

 The decorative wrought iron frame was made by the London firm of Samuel Cutler & Sons, and brought to Dublin by boat. When completed, the Gasholder was one of the largest *moving* metal structures in the world [1]

Why "moving", you may ask? The Alliance Gas Holder was actually a telescopic gas holder, floating on water. As the gasworks surrounding the tank produced gas, the gas was was pumped through the water into sections of the tank, and the gas holder *lifted itself*. 

The inner tank impressively rose up during the day and descended at night, using the beautiful Victorian iron frameworks around it as guides (check out [this video](https://youtu.be/QxCGta_rsUE?t=371) to see a similar gas holder in action).

Leaving engineering beauty aside, the industrial site was far from rosy in the South lotts back then. Some Dubliners recall:

> [The gasometers] floated on water, the pressure of the gas kept them up. So they had no bottom, and the gas used to seep into the water, and the smell sometimes got really bad, because there were leaks and the smell of gas was horrendous - Billy Ryan, 2004[0] 

> The worst thing about the gas company was the bad working
conditions. The workers should have been sent to the doctors, because
they suffered. It was very unhealthy, the fumes and all that. I think at
some stage they put up a warning that working here is a danger to
health. - Peter Montgomery, 2006 [0] 

### The downfall 

In the 20th century, two innovations called the downfall of the Gasworks: Electricity, and Natural Gas (a much cheaper way of extracting gas from deep underground rock formations, instead of extracing it from buring coal.)

Electricity became the norm for public and in-home lighting and killed demand. Natural gas became the cheaper replacement for everything else. 

The Gasworks stopped operating. The Dublin Gas Company went bankrupt, and all its assets (including the 25-acre abandonned Gasworks site in the Grand Canal Docks) were passed to Bord Gaís [3], then to the Dublin Docklands Port Authority.

### From abandon to luxury real estate

In 1996, a portion of the site (7.8 acre) was sold to developer [Liam Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Carroll_(businessman)) of Zoe Developments. But before any use could be made of the land, the Port Authority had to decontaminate it of all the chemical coumpounds that had accumulated during its industrial past.

> A [..] wall measuring 8m deep and 2km long was erected to contain the site. The whole area was then excavated to a depth of 4 metres.

The initial deconamination budget was 12 million [3] - it ended up costing €50. We're now in 2004 and the site has passed inspections - construction can start. The plan is to turn our Victorian gasholder into a nine-story apartment block, containing 210 appartments.

### The Irish property collapse

In 2006, architects o'mahony pike had completed the project. [5] Carroll put the appartments on the market, with unit prices starting from €675,000.

However, only 40 of the 210 appartments were booked by the middle of the year. Worse: there were already signs that the real estate market was about to crash. Banks were pulling back on mortgages. So the 40 prospects bailed, and never signed their contracts.[3]

Zoe developments then got a letting agent to lease out all appartments to students. From September 2008 onwards, 400 students occupied the luxury building - at discount rates. 

Zoe developments then got permission to turn the building into a hotel: it hired staff, fitted 52 bedrooms. But demand wasn't there. People weren't willing to pay the price.  

It was 2008 - the real estate market had collapsed, and Zoe Developments went bankrupt. Its assets were sold, including the Alliance.


### Google's salvation 

In 2011, the Alliance was purchased for €42 million by Kennedy Wilson - valuating each unit at around €200k - one third of the price Carroll tried to sell them for 2 years earlier. 

That same year, Google confirmed that it would acquire the buildings across the street from the Alliance [5], making it the permanent home of its 1,200 (and booming) staff. The crisis had passed, and the building was now in high demand: 80% of its occupants worked at Google.The Alliance became nicknamed "Google Land" in the media.[6]

Until today, the former Victorian Gasometer is home to hundreds of tech company workers from all over the world, including my wife and I. 

### What's next?

What does the future hold for the Alliance? Due to COVID-19, both Google and Facebook announced that they wouldn't require employees to come back to the office until mid 2021. 

Every week, movers' trucks park in the Alliance, and help one more unit pack their things out of the country. The building management introduced a €150 referral program, hoping to fill up empty units. After 10 years of prosperity, is another dark episode around the corner?

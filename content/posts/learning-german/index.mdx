I've decided to re-learn German, as we are about to move to Berlin and my work is going to be focused more closely on that country. I also feel like it's a waste to have learned German for 7 years in school and yet to **still not** be able to communicate well in that language.

Anyway — enough rambling. Here's my setup and budget to learn German:

### [SmarterGerman](https://www.smartergerman.com)

Came recommended from a friend — she mentioned that many folks inside N26 learning German as a foreign language expensed it, so it must be good. I've tried the trial version and the approach is interesting, though it **does** require self-discipline to set up time to learn, contrary to live classes which you've alredy signed up to and must attend. I'll need to create a routine if I want to effectively use this.

Cost: USD 306.27 for each class: A2, B1, and B2 ([Pricing page](https://courses.smartergerman.com))

### [Speakeasy Language School](https://www.speakeasysprachzeug.de/en/), Berlin

I know I need the discipline of a fixed-time language class to make process. Signed up to an online one, 1.5 hours every Monday and Thursday at 6:45pm DUB time. I chose this school because it has a ton of 5 start reviews on Google maps (though so do many schools in Berlin, weirdly!)
I also chose it because it _should_ be easy for me to join in-person classes there once I've moved to Berlin, creating a first social anchor and routine in the city.

Cost: EUR 149 (USD 166) for 12 hours of classes split across 1 month.

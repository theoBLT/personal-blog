I've decided to re-learn German, as Dina and I are about to move to Berlin. Plus, my work is going to be focused closely on users of that country, so at a minimum I want to understand what they write. 

I also feel like it's a waste to have learned German for 7 years in school and yet to **still not** be able to communicate well in that language, due to lack of practice during the last 9.

Here's my setup and budget to learn German:

### Dumb flash cards 

I'm starting to re-learn the words, with paper flash cards (assumption is it'll keep me away from screens for a bit longer, and give me a better sense of accomplishment).

My goal will be to have memorized the 2000 or so most common words in German by end of August 2022 ([sourced here](https://www.thegermanprofessor.com/top-500-german-words/)). That means an average of 85 words per week, which I track in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGfyftNnIFuxK60EYSrXRyUeZbe4gYvVsjGAWf9vpms/edit#gid=0).

Cost: Negligible. Possibly *some cost to source words #500 to #1000.*

### [SmarterGerman](https://www.smartergerman.com)

Came recommended from a friend â€” she mentioned that many folks inside N26 learning German as a foreign language expensed it, so it must be good. I've tried the trial version and the approach is interesting, though it **does** require self-discipline to set up time to learn, contrary to live classes which you've alredy signed up to and must attend. I'll need to create a routine if I want to effectively use this.

Cost: USD 306.27 for each class: A2, B1, and B2 ([Pricing page](https://courses.smartergerman.com)), with regular 20% discounts (e.g now with code BLITZSALE). 

### [Speakeasy Language School](https://www.speakeasysprachzeug.de/en/), Berlin

I know I need the discipline of a fixed-time language class to make process. Signed up to an online one, 1.5 hours every Monday and Thursday at 6:45pm DUB time. I chose this school because it has a ton of 5 start reviews on Google maps (though so do many schools in Berlin, weirdly!)
I also chose it because it _should_ be easy for me to join in-person classes there once I've moved to Berlin, creating a first social anchor and routine in the city.

Cost: EUR 149 (USD 166) for 12 hours of classes split across 1 month.

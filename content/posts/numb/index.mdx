I have a condition. One that I assume a lot of humans have.

* Before showering, I’ll turn on live news on my iPhone.
* While cooking, I’ll watch one the videos YouTube recommends to me.
* When jogging, I’ll always have a podcast on.
* After work, I’ll be scrolling through Twitter, or LinkedIn. 

My excuse? 

I’m a curious person. I like to learn new things.  


The reality? 

I like to numb my brain. When my brain is captivated by a screen, life becomes more comfortable. I don't have to think. I can live on autopilot. 

If I used half that captive time for productive thoughts, I think I would create more. I’d have more critical thoughts. I’d live with more directionality. 

To try and change that, I’ll start measuring with intention the share of time my brain is numbed vs. free, with the goal of reducing the numb time by 50%. [0].

I’ll report back in 30 days. [1]

_[0] Exact setup for this will be screen time measurement with iOS (iPhone, iPad), and RescueTime data, all logged inside AirTable, then grouped by day for an aggregate view. I’ll start backfilling this week, as the benchmark week._

_[1] I’ll schedule a Tweet to go out 30 days after posting this post, to keep myself accountable._

Logging the below as an ongoing friction log of my writing process.

### Steps to publish today:

1. Fire up iA Writer

1. Create a new folder inside my `posts` folder

1. Come up with a name for the folder and save it

1. Create a new file called `index.mdx` inside the folder

1. Use an Alfred snippet ( `&article`) to auto-generate the article metadata with today's date

1. Update the title inside the top section

1. Give the article a creative title

1. Give it a description

1. Add tags

1. Save file

1. Re-start my server to preview the article

1. **Now**, start writing

1. When happy with what I wrote, open a new terminal window

1. `Git status` to see where I'm at

1. `git add *`

1. `git commit -m`

1. `git push origin master`

### Complications

1. ~~The experience of writing isn't joyful: I'm editing markdown files inside VSCode. It feels technical.~~ Fixed! Now I edit with iA Writer ✨

1. It's too long to go from "I have a half-baked idea" to "I've logged it in a place"

1. I can't write those ideas on mobile. I have to be sitting down, use my personal macbook, hoping it has battery

1. I can't select existing tags to tag articles

1. Unrelatedly, my fingers hurt. Just spending 30 minutes non-stop typing hurts my finger articulations. I may need an external keyboard.

### What _does_ work

1. Using Markdown code as configuration means I'm super flexible in my choice of data organization and layout. If I want to bring this blog elsewhere, I broadly can copy paste my folder.

1. I'm flexible as to which editor I want to use (currently [iA Writer](https://ia.net/))

1. I control the structure and design of my blog with code.

### Changelog

**2022-01-29 | 17 steps → 17 steps**
Created an Alfred snippet workflow which lets me write `&article` and auto-generate the metadata scaffolding for a new article. The snippet auto-populates with today's date, thanks to [Alfred's advanced dynamic placeholders](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/placeholders/).

**2022-01-30 | 17 steps → 17 steps**
Moved all my blog's code to be stored on iCloud, which lets me edit my markdown files with iAWriter! Makes for a surprisingly great editing experience, which _also_ works on mobile! ✨

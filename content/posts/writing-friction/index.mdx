Logging the below as an ongoing friction log of my writing process.

### Steps to publish today:

1. Fire up VSCODE and open the folder which contains my site

1. Create a new folder inside my `posts` folder

1. Come up with a name for the folder and save it

1. Create a new file called `index.mdx` inside the folder

1. Use an Alfred snippet ( `&article`) to auto-generate the article metadata with today's date

1. Update the title inside the top section

1. Give the article a creative title

1. Give it a description

1. Add tags

1. Save file

1. Re-start my server to preview the article

1. **Now**, start writing

1. When happy with what I wrote, open a new terminal window

1. `Git status` to see where I'm at

1. `git add *`

1. `git commit -m`

1. `git push origin master`

### Complications

1. The experience of writing isn't joyful: I'm editing markdown files inside VSCode. It feels technical.

1. It's too long to go from "I have a half-baked idea" to "I've logged it in a place"

1. I can't write those ideas on mobile, wherever I am. I have to be sitting down, use my personal macbook, hoping it still has battery

1. I can't easily know which tags already exist to organize my new articles by

### What _does_ work

1. Using Markdown code as configuration means I'm super flexible in my choice of data organization and layout. If I want to bring this blog elsewhere, I broadly can copy paste my folder.

1. I'm also flexible as to which editor I want to use. Could be Bear on iPhone, Ulysse on Mac, some other app on iPad

1. I can iterate on the process to make publishing stuff faster. I wouldn't have that flexibility with a self-hosted wordpress (and, would need to use PHP!)

1. I have full CSS control on the blog. Can give it _any_ style or custom component I want.

### Changelog

**2022-01-29 | 17 steps â†’ 17 steps**
Created an Alfred snippet workflow which lets me write `&article` and auto-generate the metadata scaffolding for a new article. The snippet auto-populates with today's date, thanks to [Alfred's advanced dynamic placeholders](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/placeholders/).

## The problem 

I rarely discuss my topics of interest: technology, climate, politics, life goals or societal changes. One exception: online finance, which [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) pays me to improve. 

My partner? She has other interests. My friends? We do not go deep â€”before 4am and too many drinks. Religion? Its rituals and mythology threw me off. Family? My sister and I rarely have a chance to debate our fascinatingly different world view. 

Where could I go solve this yearn for deeper thinking?

## Enter organised groups

Let's try and think what groups could help.

### Freemasonry

A current member [recently explained ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5tseGG9u9g) how his group operates. It peeked my interest:

1. Fortnightly, someone presents a topic for 8 minutes. The group listens in silence.
1. One at a time, senior audience members share their thoughts. Junior members keep on listening.
1. That's it. No conclusion, no solution. 

I'm a sucker for structure, and giving each person time to speak as a marker of respect. This could be an answer, I thought! 

Then I dug deeper, read about freemasonry's reputation for lack of diversity in income, gender and race diversity. Their [application page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210510072954/https://freemason.ie/application-for-membership/) in Ireland is explicit: "Any **man** of the age of 21 may join [...] although **he** is **expected to have a faith**". Mandatory religion and no women? Not for me.

### Debate clubs 

I need to research how those work: I haven't been part of one. I picture them as more *aggressive* than discussion forums, due to the necessity of *fighting* an opposing view. That may be further from my personality. 

However, that's something I should explore! 

### Friends circle

I'm shy in nature and not an organizer â€” but other people aren't and have solved for this problem. Gillian Morris [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gillianemorris/) has for years gathered friends in her home to have dinner, discuss and present ideas. 

I'll need to participate in or organize one. A challenge for my April 2022 move to ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Berlin!

### Online discussion forums 

The asynchronous, open-to-all, long-form version of online discussion forums are places where I *could* see myself learn and participate: Reddit, for example. Focusing on my interests, I found and joined those sub-reddits:

* [r/EffectiveAltruism](https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/)
* [r/Ethics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethics/)
* [r/neoliberal](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/)
* [r/unpopularopinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/)
* [r/Documentaries/](https://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/)

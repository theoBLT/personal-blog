# The problem 

I have observed a gap in my life for the last 5 years: I do not have opportunities to discuss and form opinions on fundamental issues: politics, goals in life, societal changes, economy, the environment, philosophy. 

As a private employee of a company in the finance space, the deepest thinking I get to do is *the one for which I am economically incentivized*. Finance trends, advancing the online economy. 

Beyond this, I do *not* have a forum to discuss other important topics:
- My partner is uninterested
- With my friends, discussions rarely dive into deep topics (or if they do, it's 4am and both our brains aren't there)
- I do not believe or participate in any religion, the traditional forums to explore those topics.

One of the rare opportunities I have to do this is with my sister, who's got a fascinatingly different worldview from mine. 

Beyond that, what should I do to solve my need for deeper thinking?

## Organised groups

### Freemasonry
A current member recently explained how his group operates:
* Fortnightly, someone presents a topic for 8 minutes. The group silently listens.
* One at a time, senior audience members get to share their thoughts on the topic. Junior members only get to listen.
* That's it. No attempt at a conclusion, or solving the problem. 

The structure and presumably ego-less setup of the freemasons appeal to me. Not seeking consensus and giving each person time to speak shows respect for individual opinions. I could see myself make room for deep listening and opinion-forming every month, provided that the organization's reputation for lack of diversity in income, gender and race diversity is just that: a reputation. 

### Debate clubs 

I need to research how those work: I haven't, nor have I been part of one. I picture them as more *aggressive* than discussion forums, due to the necessity of *fighting* an opposing view. That may be further from my personality. 

However, that's something I should explore! 

### Friends circle

I'm shy in nature and not an organizer â€” but other people aren't and have solved for this problem. Gillian Morris [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gillianemorris/) has for years gathered friends in her home to have dinner, discuss and present ideas. 

I'll need to participate in or organize one. A challenge for my April 2022 move to ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Berlin!

### Online discussion forums 

The asynchronous, open-to-all, long-form version of online discussion forums are places where I *could* see myself learn and participate: Reddit, for example. Focusing on my interests, I found and joined those sub-reddits:

* [r/EffectiveAltruism](https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/)
* [r/Ethics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethics/)
* [r/neoliberal](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/)
* [r/unpopularopinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/)
* [r/Documentaries/](https://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/)
